# Where did I put it :woman_shrugging:

This app is designed for **mobile use only** currently. I was motivated to create this project because my mom kept forgetting which house she left her things. I wanted to solve her problem by creating a mobile app that keeps track of where her things are. I leveraged my web dev skills to create a mobile app using a PWA and IndexedDB.

## Project details
- State management is maintained by [vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/).
- App design created in [Penpot](https://penpot.app/).
- [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) for the UI.
- [IndexedDB](https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb) for data storage.
- [Vue router](https://router.vuejs.org/) used for multi-page routing. 

## Project todo
This is a list of features and fixes I intend to address for the project:

- [ ] Onboarding screen
- [X] Snackbar to alert users when a CRUD action has taken place
- [ ] Move item categories to state management
- [X] Fix qty slider to be more user friendly
- [ ] Change PWA loading screen
- [ ] Add logo to favicon and app icon
- [ ] Form validation
