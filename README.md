# Where did I put it

This app is designed for **mobile use only** so far. This project was motivated by my mom forgetting her things in the different houses she lives in, and I wanted to create a mobile app experience to solve this issue for her by using a PWA and indexedDB.

## Project details
State management is maintained by [vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/).
App design created in [Penpot](https://penpot.app/).
[Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) for the UI.
[IndexedDB](https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb) for data storage.
[Vue router](https://router.vuejs.org/) used for multi-page routing. 

## Project todo
This is a list of features and fixes I intend to address for the project:

- [ ] Onboarding screen
- [ ] Snackbar to alert users when a CRUD action has taken place
- [ ] Move item categories to state management
- [ ] Fix qty slider to be more user friendly
- [ ] Change PWA loading screen
- [ ] Add logo to favicon and app icon
